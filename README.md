# fastApiProject

This is a file browser.

backend using fastapi, frontend using godot(though there are better choices, but all right)

# TODO:

1. Later will more concern with frontend, instead of backend.
   
   1. `godot` is too slow
   
   2. `Qt` is not suitable for phone. and there are more convenient programs for mulipulate files in computer, i just want to use it at phone.
   
   3. `react-native` maybe is a great option

2. and i will remove the ability of multiply user, as it has no sense for me and most user

3. i would concern more at usability and **security**



*because of the changes of interface*, both qt and godot version frontend is not usable!
